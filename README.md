# RiceENCODE datasets pipeline
## What is RiceENCODE:
<br>The application of Hi-C, ChIA-PET, and other chromosome conformation capture technologies in plants in recent years has have made a the research on the spatial structure of plant genomes more and more important. With the continuous increase of a large number of plant chromosome interaction data, how to query the epigenetic modification and interaction information efficiently and quickly has become a major problem.Here we combine the published three-dimensional interactive data ChIA-PET, Hi-C and the epigenomic datasets (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq,MNase-seq, FAIRE-seq, WGBS, RNA-seq and ncRNA-seq) to construct a comprehensive rice Encyclopedia of DNA Elements database (RiceENCODE). This database contains 937 datasets, which is the largest one for rice epigenomics up to our best knowledge, which can help us to outline the rice epigenome in a comprehensive way, and provide an important platform for studying rice molecular breeding, genetic mechanisms, tissue specificities and subgroup properties in epigenetic regulation.</br>
